Welcome to the approximate number sense (ANS) test!

You will see see images with coloured dots on both the left and the right side for 0.75 seconds before it disappears. You then have 3 seconds to answer which side you think had more dots. There will be 40 questions in total with a 1.5 second gap between each question. Good luck!
